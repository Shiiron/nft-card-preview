## My process

### Built with

- Angular
- Netlify (for hosting)

### What I learned

- Creating a new basic Angular project (that i will use for other frontend mentor challenge)
- Setting up and deploying my solution on Netlify
- Creating overlay for images

Easy and simple project but a very good way to get me into frontend mentor projects. I do think the result is not yet perfect and i could implement a lot of things. I sure will look for that in my next try !
